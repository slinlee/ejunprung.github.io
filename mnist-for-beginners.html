  <img src="/img/mnist_render.png"><br>
  <p>MNIST is a database containing images of handwritten digits, with each image labeled by integer. It is used to benchmark the performance of machine learning algorithms. Deep learning performs quite well on MNIST, achieving more than 99.7% accuracy.</p>
  <p>We will use MNIST to train a neural network to look at each image and predict the digit. The first step is to install Deeplearning4j.</p>

  <h2 id="mnist-dataset">The MNIST Dataset</h2>
  <p>The MNIST dataset contains a <b>training set</b> of 60,000 examples, and a <b>test set</b> of 10,000 examples. The training set is used to teach the algorithm to predict the correct label, the integer, while the test set is used to check how accurately the trained network can make guesses.</p>
  <p>In the machine learning world, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank">supervised learning</a>, because we have the correct answers for the images we’re making guesses about. The training set can therefore act as a supervisor, or teacher, correcting the neural network when it guesses wrong.</p>
