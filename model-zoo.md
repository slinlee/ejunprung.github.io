# Preconfigured Deeplearning4j Models

The Deeplearning4j community has built a number of preconfigured neural networks for image recognition:

* [AlexNet](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/model-configurations/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/AlexNet.java)
* [LeNet](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/model-configurations/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/LeNet.java)
* [VGGNetA](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/model-configurations/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/VGGNetA.java)
* [VGGNetD](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/model-configurations/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/VGGNetD.java)

While this is not exactly Caffe's model zoo, it will give you a headstart when creating models for image recognition. We'll be adding to this page as we have pretrained parameters to offer.
