# Saving and Loading a Neural Network
The ModelSerializer is a class which handles loading and saving models. There are 2 methods for saving (in the examples below)
The first example saves a normal multi layer network, the second one saves a [computation graph](https://deeplearning4j.org/compgraph)

Below is an example of loading either a multilayernetwork or a computation graph:
[See the example test](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-core/src/test/java/org/deeplearning4j/util/ModelSerializerTest.java)
