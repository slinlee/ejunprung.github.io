# Custom Datasets 

All input to the deep-learning nets -- whether it's words, images or other data -- must be transformed into numbers known as vectors, in a process called vectorization. A vector is simply a one-column matrix with an extendible number of rows.

## Canova

Canova is a general vectorization library for machine learning that works with multiple datatypes that integrates with the Deeplearning4j suite of open-source libs. Here are two examples of how to use it:

* [Customized Image Data Pipeline](http://deeplearning4j.org/image-data-pipeline.html)
* [Vectorizing an IRIS CSV](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/Canova/wiki/Vectorizing-CSV-Data-With-Canova-and-the-CLI)
